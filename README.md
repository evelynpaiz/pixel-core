# Pixel Core
Pixel Core is a rendering engine built from scratch, supporting both OpenGL and Metal for cross-platform graphics.

## Requirements
* [Git](https://git-scm.com): Required for version control.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org): Used for generating platform-specific build files.
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/): The underlying graphics API.
* [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/): GPU framework for macOS and iOS.
* C++ Compiler: A modern C++ compiler compatible with C++20 or later.
    
## Getting started
<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>
Clone the repository recursively to ensure all submodules are downloaded:
```
git clone --recursive [Repository URL]
```
and access the directory of the cloned repository.

To clone the necessary submodules, if the repository was cloned non-recursively, use:
```
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

<ins>**2. Build the project solution:**</ins>
The project solution can be generated using CMake:

* **For Visual Studio**:
	```
	cmake -B VisualStudio
	```
	The Visual Studio solution `pixel-core.sln` can be found in the `VisualStudio/` directory.

* **For XCode**:
	```
	cmake -G Xcode -B XCode
	```
	The XCode project solution `pixel-core.xcodeproj` can be found in `XCode/` directory.

## Third party libraries
